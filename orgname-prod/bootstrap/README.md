This directory should only exist if the AWS account was not already setup for Terraform remote state and locking. That's the case for a brand new AWS account or an account that's never been managed by Terraform.

This should be populated by the contents of
[terraform-aws-bootstrap](https://github.com/trussworks/terraform-aws-bootstrap).
